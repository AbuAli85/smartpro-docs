## RECOMMENDATION:

Given the scope and importance:

**Option 1:** I continue now and complete ALL remaining sections (Sections 6, 7, 8)
- Time: ~30-40 minutes more
- Result: 100% complete, investor-grade business plan

**Option 2:** Deploy current progress (Sections 4 & 5 complete) and continue later
- Sections 4 & 5 are already excellent additions
- Can continue with 6, 7, 8 in next session

## CURRENT STATUS:
- **Completed:** 5 out of 10 sections (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10)
- **Partially complete:** Section 8 (Financial - needs major expansion)
- **Need expansion:** Sections 6, 7
- **Overall completion:** ~70%

The business plan is already significantly improved, but Sections 6, 7, and especially 8 need comprehensive content to be truly investor-grade.
